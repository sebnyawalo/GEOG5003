Agent Based Modelling Agent Based Modelling is, in some senses, the culmination of the methods we've looked at so far. It integrates crime and environmental data, along with behavioural and demographic data about offenders and victims to create a platform which can be used for both predictive estimation and theoretical studies. Agent Based Models aim to provide a in silico lab, where we can:

Capture our understanding of systems.
Test that understanding of the systems for coherence and comprehensiveness.
See how theory at the individual level creates aggregate patterns.
Validate that theory against real data at the aggregate and individual scale.
Make predictions about the system.s
Test "what if?" scenarios to inform planning
