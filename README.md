# GEOG5003
This is an ABM model which takes in the following parameters

  .num_of_agents # defines the number of agents
  .num_of_iterations # defines the number of iterations
  .neighbourhood # defines the maximum distance within which agents can interact with one another
  
The model takes in data from a web-page containing x,y and Z values to create agents. additionally the model also reads data from an external file containing 2D list simulating an enviroment. an enviroment represent 2D space where the agents can interact with other agents and other elements in that space. in this model agents can move freely, "eat", modify and share there resources with other agents provided that they are within the neighborhood.
